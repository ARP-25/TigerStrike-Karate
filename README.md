## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The pictures throughout the site are chosen to present the TigerStrike Karate School including their sensei and students. The viewer is directly given the information of what he can expect joining the school. 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The color Scheme is adjusted to fit to a Karate School. For example a Karate Gi is usually associated with a white robe and a black belt and just has a minimal look. Therefore a simple white has been chosen for the font and a dark gray (rgb(31, 33, 34))for the background and several elements to keep it clean and provide a good contrast.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts was used to import Roboto Condensed font into styles.css.  It was chosen because it has a modern design, balanced proportions and open letterforms which contribute to its readability.
