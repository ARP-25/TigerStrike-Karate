# Description
TigerStrike Karate is a fictional Webpage installed to extend the online presence for the TigerStrike Karate School. The viewer will be able to get a first look into the Karate School by seeing students in practice and getting a introduction of the sensei(main coach). Website visitors will also be able to see the location of the school, opening hours and class times. Furthermore there is a signup form, where you are actually able to sign up online to the karate school or just leave a non-committal inquiry via the message form at the front page.
